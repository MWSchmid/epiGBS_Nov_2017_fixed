RnBeads Galaxy wrapper
======================

XML wrapper for making rnbeads a galaxy tool.
---------------------------------------------

How it works
============

The xml file is almost complete except for three changes, labeled with: [1], [2] and [3]. These three values need to be changed to the right directory/file. Then, after adding the .xml to the tools in your tool_conf.xml in your Galaxy, you're good to go.
