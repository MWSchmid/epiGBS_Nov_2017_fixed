RnBeads 0.99.17
===============

 * Consistency issues with Bioconductor 3.0 fixed

RnBeads 0.99.16
===============

 * Enhanced XML-based analysis though the tag preanalysis.script
 * Optimized loading of the sequencing data sets
 * Enhanced region profiles plots. Added region site distribution plots 
 * Locus profiles can now be generated in the exploratory report for regions specified in custom bed files and for genes listed as gene symbols
 * Improved cell type heterogeneity inference (no cell types excluded anymore)
 * Added more support for paired differential methylation with limma
 * Some functions were renamed: merge.samples->mergeSamples, add.pheno->addPheno, add.region.subsegments->addRegionSubsegments, and all functions operating on Report
 * Added helper classes for submitting RnBeads to a scientific compute cluster. Current implementation includes Sun Grid Engine
 * The default pipeline now uses ff functionality and saves intermediate objects into the report directory 
 * Minor bugfixes

RnBeads 0.99.15
===============

 * Restructuring of the pipeline modules:
 ** the loading module has been renamed to import
 ** the prefiltering,normalization and postfiltering modules have been summarized in a new module: preprocessing
 ** the batch and profiles modules have been summarized in a new module for exploratory analysis
 ** the export module has been renamed to tracks and tables
 ** corresponding option names have been changed
 ** see the overview figure on the website or the vignette for a quick overview on the new module structure
 * Multiple RnBSets can now be concatenated with the add() function
 * Multiple samples in an RnBSet can be merged using the merge.samples() function
 * Gender prediction can be performed on Infinium 450k datasets
 * Minor updates on covariate adjustment
 * Updates on tissue heterogeneity estimation
 * Calling differentially methylated sites with RefFreeEWAS now supports paired design
